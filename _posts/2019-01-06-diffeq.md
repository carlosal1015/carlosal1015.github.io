# Write differential equations very easily with `diffcoeff`!

Often, the mathematician needs to represent mathematical expressions such as differential equations. So that this is not a nightmare, the mathematician [Andrew Parsloe](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02189611) created a package that offers super useful commands. This post will deal with such commands, show the results without the package and with the package to see the differences. Let's go!

<!--more-->

In the first place, we need to load the package `diffcoeff`. I recommend using the last version, i.e., version 3.0. It's available on TeXLive distribution for all platforms like GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows 10, and so on. 

The `diffcoeff` package works thanks to $$\LaTeX 3_{\varepsilon}$$ kernel.

$\diff{y}{x}$

$\diff{\ln x}/{x}$

$\diff[2]yx$

$\diff[n+1]yx$

$\diff[1]yx$

$\diff[2]y/x$

$\diff[n+1]y/x$

$\diff{\ln\sin x}{\sin x}\diff{\sin x}x$

$\diff[2]{\ln\sin x}{\sin x}$

$\diff[2]{\ln\sin x}{\sin x}$

$\diff{f(x)}1/x{},\quad\diff{f(x)}{(1/x)}$

$\diff{\nilmu f(x)}{\onemu 1/x},\quad\diff{\nilmu f(x)}{(1/x)}$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$$

$$\mathrm{d} \ln x/\mathrm{d}x$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^{n+1}y}{\mathrm{d}x^{n+1}}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$$

$$\mathrm{d}^2y/\mathrm{d}x^2$$

$$\mathrm{d}^{n+1}y/\mathrm{d}x^{n+1}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}\ln\sin x}{\mathrm{d}\sin x}\frac{\mathrm{d}\sin x}{\mathrm{d}x}$$


$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\ln\sin x}{\mathrm{d}{\left(\sin x\right)}^2}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}f(x)}{\mathrm{d}1/x},\quad\frac{\mathrm{d}f(x)}{\mathrm{d}(1/x)}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}\ f(x)}{\mathrm{d}\ 1/x},\quad\frac{\mathrm{d}\ f(x)}{\mathrm{d}\ (1/x)}$$
